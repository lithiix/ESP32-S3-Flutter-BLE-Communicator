      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 13, 2026</p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how the
        <strong>ESP32 BLE Connect</strong> (“the App”) operates and explains our
        commitment to user privacy.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
      <p>
        The ESP32 BLE Connect App is designed as a local controller.
        <strong
          >We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from our
          users.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>The app’s primary functions are to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Connect with an ESP32 board via local network or Bluetooth.</li>
        <li>Send control commands to the hardware.</li>
        <li>Display data received from the ESP32 device in real-time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All communication happens locally between your mobile device and the
        ESP32 board. No data is transmitted to external servers or third-party
        databases.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
      <p>
        To function correctly, the App may request the following permissions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Bluetooth & Wi-Fi:</strong> Used exclusively to communicate
          with your ESP32 board.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Location Access:</strong> On Android, scanning for Bluetooth
          or Wi-Fi devices requires location permissions.
          <strong
            >The App does not track, record, or share your physical GPS
            location.</strong
          >
          This permission is used solely to facilitate the hardware connection.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        Since the App does not collect or store personal data, there is no risk
        of personal data exposure through this application. Security is
        maintained by the local nature of the connection.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        The ESP32 Control App does not use any third-party analytics,
        advertising, or tracking SDKs that collect user information.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        This App does not knowingly collect any personal data from children.
        Since no data collection occurs, the App is compliant with privacy
        regulations regarding all age groups.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you
        of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
      </p>
